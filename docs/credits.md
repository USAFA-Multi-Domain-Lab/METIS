## Vision & Leadership

**METIS** was conceived and envisioned by **Michael Golembesky**, Air & Space Ops Wargaming Lab Director at the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) Multi-Domain Laboratory (MDL). His vision for an immersive, scalable cybersecurity training platform laid the foundation for what METIS has become.

## Development Team

The METIS platform was engineered and developed from the ground up by **GovCIO** under contract with the USAFA Multi-Domain Laboratory.

### Engineers

**Jordan Stokes** - _Lead Software Engineer & Architect_

- System architecture and design
- Full-stack development (backend, API, web application, database, integration)
- Testing and deployment

**Jacob Thomas** - _Software Engineer_

- Full-stack development (backend, API, web application, database, integration)
