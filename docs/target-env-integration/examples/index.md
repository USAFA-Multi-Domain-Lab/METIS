# Target Environment Examples

This section provides real-world examples demonstrating different patterns and approaches for implementing target environments in METIS. Each example includes complete code implementations and explanations of key concepts.

## Available Examples

### Getting Started

- **[Basic Target Example](basic-target.md)** - Simple target implementation with minimal configuration
  - Single target with basic arguments
  - Straightforward execution logic
  - Perfect for learning the fundamentals

### Advanced Patterns

- **[Complex Target Example](complex-target.md)** - Advanced features and patterns
  - Multiple targets in one environment
  - Complex argument types and validation
  - Advanced context usage and error handling

### Version Management

- **[Migration Example](migration-example.md)** - Version upgrade patterns and data migration
  - Handling schema changes between versions
  - Data transformation during upgrades
  - Backward compatibility strategies

## How to Use These Examples

1. **Start with Basic** - Review the basic target example to understand core concepts
2. **Explore Advanced** - Move to complex patterns once you're comfortable with basics
3. **Plan for Growth** - Study migration patterns before deploying to production
