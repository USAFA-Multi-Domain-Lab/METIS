# Target Environment Examples

Learn by example! These real-world implementations show you exactly how to build target environments, from simple operations to complex integrations. Copy, modify, and use these as starting points for your own projects.

## 📋 Available Examples

### **[Basic Target Example](basic-target.md)** - Start here

Perfect first example showing fundamental concepts:

- Single target with simple arguments
- Clean execution logic and error handling
- Ready to copy and modify

### **[Complex Target Example](complex-target.md)** - Advanced patterns

Production-ready patterns for sophisticated use cases:

- Multiple targets in one environment
- Complex argument validation and UI components
- Advanced context usage and WebSocket integration

## How to Use These Examples

1. **Read the code first** - Each example includes complete, working implementations
2. **Copy what you need** - Use these as templates for your own targets
3. **Adapt and extend** - Modify the patterns to fit your specific requirements
