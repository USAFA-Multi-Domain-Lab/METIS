# Target Environment Integration

Welcome to the METIS Target Environment Integration documentation. This section provides comprehensive guidance for creating and integrating target environments into the METIS system.

## What is the Target-Effect System?

The target-effect system is METIS's framework for creating reusable, configurable operations that can be executed during mission sessions. Target environments provide collections of **targets** (operation templates) that users can configure into **effects** (specific operation instances) within their missions.

## Getting Started
