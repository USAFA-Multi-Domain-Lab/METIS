# Implementation Guides

Step-by-step guides for developing and implementing target environments in METIS. These guides provide detailed instructions, best practices, and practical advice for building production-ready target environments.

## Development Workflow

### Core Setup

- **[Creating Target Environments](creating-target-environments.md)** - Environment setup and project structure
  - Project initialization and file organization
  - Configuration setup and environment variables
  - Integration with METIS server

### Target Development

- **[Defining Targets](defining-targets.md)** - Creating target operations and business logic
  - Target schema definition and validation
  - Implementing target execution logic
  - Error handling and debugging

### Configuration & Types

- **[Argument Types](argument-types.md)** - Working with typed arguments and validation
  - Available argument types and their properties
  - Custom validation rules and patterns
  - UI integration and user experience

### Version Management

- **[Migrations](migrations.md)** - Version management and data migrations
  - Planning version upgrades
  - Writing migration scripts
  - Testing and deployment strategies

### Production Readiness

- **[Best Practices](best-practices.md)** - Recommended patterns and conventions
  - Code organization and architecture patterns
  - Performance optimization
  - Security considerations and testing strategies

## Recommended Learning Path

1. **Environment Setup** → Start with creating your development environment
2. **Basic Targets** → Learn to define simple targets with basic arguments
3. **Advanced Arguments** → Master complex argument types and validation
4. **Production Patterns** → Study best practices before deploying
5. **Version Management** → Plan for future updates and migrations
