# METIS (Modular Effects-Based Transmitter for Integrated Simulations)

## purpose

METIS uses an ambiguous node-topography and hierarchy structure to build a framework that relays effects across all war-fighting domains — designed to be adaptable to a wide variety of use cases, from cyberspace targeting to global logistical operations. As a secondary function, and equally as flexible, is the open software design that uses an Application Programming Interface (API) to perform as a relay hub and/or effects-emitter to link multiple simulation programs and other applications.
