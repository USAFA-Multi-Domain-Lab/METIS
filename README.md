# METIS (Modular Effects-Based Transmitter for Integrated Simulations)

## purpose

METIS uses an ambiguous node-topography and hierarchy structure to build a framework relayed effects from across all war-fighting domains. Designed to be adaptable to a wide verity of use cases, from cyberspace targeting to global logistical operations. As a secondary function, and equally as flexible is the open software design that uses API to perform as a relay hub and/or effects-emitter to link multiple simulation programs and other applications.
